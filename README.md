# Crypto-Chatbot
For this project I was tasked with utilising 2 crypto API's to provide us with information on cryptocurrencies. With this information the system checks value of the coin in the past few days to check if it is worth investing into. Despite the poor investment advice, if this information was good enough to be shared, a "Twitter" post would be"posted"

Please see the attached document that contains the documentation, video run-through, and evaluation of the project.
Additionally I have provided the code in python for you to have a look through too. :)
